## **Testing**

** **


## **Functionality Testing**

I used Mozilla Web Developer Tools and Chrome Developer Tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style.

## **Compatibility Testing**

The site has been tested across multiple virtual devices and browsers using developer tools.  Browser testing on Safari, Edge, Firefox and Chrome.

The site has been tested across multiple non-virtual devices, including iPhone 8 and iPad Mini 2.

## **Performance testing**

All pages pass through [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) with no major concerns.

## **Accessibility Testing**

Accessibility testing using [WebAim Wave - Web Acessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

## **Code Validation**

Testing has been carried out using the following web services:

HTML on all pages validated using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
CSS validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## **Code Validation Issues**

When validating the tactics.html page, an issue was revealed in that you cannot have a h3 element as a descendant of a th element.  Therefore I had to remove the h3 element and I have restyled **th.Rtable-cell** to mimic a h3 element.

## **Peer Code Review**

At the suggestion of my mentor I submitted my code for Peer Code Review in the **Code Institute** Slack channel.  Please see the names of the reviewers below in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

The results were:
*	A bug on the 404 page whereby the Rapier Group text in the top left of the page does not link back to the home page - Fixed.
*	A suggestion to left-align the text in the list container on planning.html, so that the bullets aren't floating separately to the text - Fixed and it looks so much better now.
*	Consider adding more space below the table on tactics.html as it was slightly overlapped by the footer element - Fixed.

## **User Testing**

**Visitor Goals**

> As a website visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the organisation.
>
>> The name of the business and what the company does is evident on the home page.  The different sections on the home page provide more opportunity to learn about the organisation.

> As a website visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.
>
>> Each page has a navigation bar at the top allowing the user to navigate between the pages.  Since the home page is longer than the others, a back-to-top button has been included to allow the user to quickly get back to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

> As a website visitor, I want to be able to view the website clearly on any mobile device.
>
>> The website is responsive at different screen widths.  For a description of the responsive features, please see [Features](#features).

> As a website visitor, I want to know what services are provided by the organisation.
>
>> The Planning and Tactics pages provide information about the services provided by Rapier Marketing.

> As a website visitor, I would like to see examples of previous projects undertaken by the organisation.
>
>> The Past Projects and Testimonials sections on the home page provide information about what the organisation has previously undertaken.
